### Part One: The Evolution of Human Civilization

#### [Chapter 1: The Fundamental Needs of Human Civilization](chapters/brief/chapter01.html)

How ancient civilizations tried to achieve minimum cost and maximum freedom through divine authority and faith systems? Why did it ultimately fail?

---

#### [Chapter 3: Moral Civilization](chapters/brief/chapter03.html)

#### [Chapter 4: Material Civilization](chapters/brief/chapter04.html)
**The material competition between capitalism and socialism**

When civilization shifted focus to material production and distribution, what was created? What was lost? Why do both paths fail?

#### [Chapter 5: Contribution-First Civilization](chapters/brief/chapter05.html)
**The birth of the fourth civilizational form**

From theocracy → moral → material → contribution, why is Contribution-First the natural next stage of evolution? How can it truly achieve civilization's four goals?

---

### Part Two: Theory (The Philosophical Foundation of Contribution-First)

#### [Chapter 6: The Revolution from Possession to Contribution](chapters/brief/chapter06.html)
**The fundamental paradigm shift of civilization**

Why is "possession" the root of suffering? How does "contribution" break the thousand-year deadlock? This is not utopia, but logical necessity.

## 📚 Detailed Edition Table of Contents

*Suitable for in-depth study (20-40 minutes per chapter)*

---

### Part One: The Evolution of Human Civilization

#### [Chapter 1: The Fundamental Needs of Human Civilization](chapters/detailed/chapter01.html)
**Minimum cost, minimum constraints, maximum power, maximum freedom**

**Core Arguments:**
- What is "cost"? Material, time, freedom, dignity
- What are "constraints"? External coercion vs. internal limitations
- What is "power"? Choice, decision-making authority, influence
- What is "freedom"? Negative freedom vs. positive freedom

**Historical Evidence:**
- From tribes to empires, every civilizational transformation optimizes these four dimensions
- Why do some civilizations endure while others quickly perish?
- Trade-offs among the four dimensions: Impossible trinity? Or can all be achieved?

**Theoretical Framework:**
- Civilization assessment matrix
- Evolutionary dynamics
- Technological change and institutional lag

*Reading time: Approximately 35 minutes*

---

#### [Chapter 2: God's Civilization](chapters/detailed/chapter02.html)
**How to achieve (and truly realize) minimum cost, minimum constraints, maximum power, maximum freedom**

**Logic of Theocratic Civilization:**
- How divine absolute authority reduces coordination costs
- How faith internalizes constraints (no external coercion needed)
- How "God's will" legitimizes individual action

**Real Implementation:**
- Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mayan civilization cases
- Actual effects of religious codes (Code of Hammurabi, Mosaic Law)
- Power monopoly and corruption of priestly classes

**Why It Failed:**
- Struggle over interpretation of divine will
- Rise of scientific rationality
- Enormous cost of religious wars

**Legacy and Lessons:**
- Importance of spiritual support
- Cohesive power of common belief
- But cannot be built on unverifiable foundations

*Reading time: Approximately 40 minutes*
