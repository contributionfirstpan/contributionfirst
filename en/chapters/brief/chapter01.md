# Chapter 1: The Fundamental Needs of Human Civilization

## Core Question

Why do humans establish civilizational systems? What is civilization's ultimate purpose?

**Answer: To optimize four dimensions**

---

## The Four Fundamental Needs of Civilization

### 1. Minimum Cost

**What is "cost"?**
- Consumption of material resources
- Investment of time and energy
- Sacrifice of freedom and dignity
- Cost of conflict and harm

**Why minimize?**
- Humans instinctively pursue efficiency
- Limited resources require optimal allocation
- Reducing suffering is a universal aspiration

**Historical evidence:**
- From barter → currency → digital payments: Continuously decreasing transaction costs
- From war → diplomacy → international law: Declining conflict resolution costs
- From human labor → animal power → machinery → AI: Decreasing labor costs

---

### 2. Minimum Constraints

**What are "constraints"?**
- External coercion (laws, norms, authoritative commands)
- Internal limitations (fear, shame, guilt)
- Narrowing of choices (what you cannot do, what you must do)

**Why minimize?**
- Human nature yearns for freedom
- Excessive constraints suppress creativity
- Constraints themselves require costs to maintain

**Historical evidence:**
- From theocracy → monarchy → democracy: Decreasing authoritative constraints
- From harsh laws → human rights law: Rationalization of legal constraints
- From traditional taboos → individual freedom: Loosening cultural constraints

---

### 3. Maximum Power

**What is "power"?**
- Choice (ability to decide what to do)
- Decision-making authority (ability to influence outcomes)
- Influence (ability to change environment and others)

**Why maximize?**
- Power means autonomy
- No power = inability to control destiny
- Power is the foundation of dignity

**Historical evidence:**
- From slaves → serfs → free people → citizens: Expanding individual power
- From rule by few → decision by many: Dispersing political power
- From information monopoly → democratization of knowledge: Popularizing cognitive power

---

### 4. Maximum Freedom

**What is "freedom"?**
- Negative freedom: Non-interference (freedom from violence, not being coerced)
- Positive freedom: Capability to achieve (education, resources, opportunities)
- Internal freedom: Psychological liberation (without fear, without anxiety)

**Why maximize?**
- Freedom is the core of human dignity
- Freedom unleashes creative potential
- Freedom is the prerequisite for happiness

**Historical evidence:**
- From personal dependence → freedom of movement: Physical freedom
- From thought control → freedom of speech: Spiritual freedom
- From survival struggle → career choice: Economic freedom

## The Relationship Between the Four Dimensions

### Not Contradictory, But Unified

**Common misconceptions:**
- "Freedom and order are contradictory"
- "Power and equality are opposed"
- "Low cost and high freedom are incompatible"

**Truth:**
- Good civilizational systems can simultaneously optimize all four dimensions
- The key lies in institutional design
- Technological progress expands the boundaries of possibility

### Trade-offs and Evolution

**Trade-offs in Different Civilizations:**
- Theocracy: Low material cost (simple living), but high constraints (religious precepts)
- Moral civilization: Low external constraints (self-discipline), but high internal pressure (moral judgment)
- Capitalism: High individual freedom (market choice), but high social cost (inequality, ecology)
- Socialism: Low inequality (fair distribution), but low economic freedom (planned control)

**Direction of Evolution:**
Each civilizational transformation attempts to simultaneously improve all four dimensions

## Civilization Assessment Framework

| Civilization Type | Cost | Constraints | Power | Freedom | Overall Score |
|------------------|------|-------------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Primitive Tribes | High | Medium | Low | Low | ★★ |
| Theocratic Empires | Medium | High | Very Low | Very Low | ★★ |
| Feudal Society | High | High | Very Low | Very Low | ★ |
| Capitalism | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium-High | ★★★ |
| Socialism (20th C) | Medium | High | Low | Low | ★★ |
| **Contribution-First (Ideal)** | **Low** | **Very Low** | **High** | **Very High** | **★★★★★** |

## Key Insights

### 1. Civilization is Not Static

- Every civilization has a life cycle
- Technological progress creates new possibilities
- "Solutions" of old systems become "new problems"

### 2. Civilization Assessment Must Consider Historical Context

- Ancient theocratic civilizations were optimal in their time
- Medieval feudalism also had its rationality
- We cannot judge the past by today's standards

### 3. But We Cannot Remain in the Past

- 21st-century technology has created new possibilities
- If institutions don't evolve, enormous tension arises
- **Current predicament: 21st-century technology + 19th-century institutions**

---

## Leading to the Next Chapter

**What was humanity's first attempt to achieve these four goals?**

**Answer: God.**

In the next chapter, we will see how theocratic civilization tried to build order through faith and reverence, why it succeeded for thousands of years, and why it ultimately failed.
