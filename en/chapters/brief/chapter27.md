## A Day in the Life

### Protagonist: Lin Yue, 35 years old

**Background:**
- Lives in community near Shanghai, China (population 5,000)
- Occupation: AI ethics researcher + amateur musician
- Family: Partner (cohabiting, not married), one child (8 years old)

---

### Morning (7:00-9:00)

**7:00 - Natural Wake**
```
No alarm:
- Don't need to rush to work
- Flexible work hours
    ↓
Bedroom:
- Minimalist, eco-friendly materials
- Window overlooks community garden
- Sunlight streams in
```

**Lin Yue's first thought:**
> "What do I want to do today?"
> 
> Not: "What must I do today?"

**7:15 - AI Assistant "Hui" Greets**
```
"Good morning, Yue. Did you sleep well?"
    ↓
Hui (personal AI):
- Knows all of Lin Yue's preferences
- 24/7 companion (but doesn't disturb)
- Provides information, advice, support
- Completely transparent, controllable
```

**Hui's report:**
```
"Three things today that might interest you:
1. Community gardening group at 9am (you said last week you wanted to join)
2. Your research project has new peer reviews (two experts, both very positive)
3. Improvisational music session tonight, wondering if you'll participate"
```

**Lin Yue chooses:**
- First check research reviews (excited)
- Attend gardening activity (relaxation)
- Evening performance (creation)

---

**7:30 - Breakfast**
```
At table:
- Partner already up, preparing breakfast
- Child still sleeping (no need to wake early for school)
    ↓
Food:
- Organic, locally produced
- Community shared kitchen provides (can also cook yourself)
- Nutritionally balanced (AI suggests based on body data)
```

**Conversation:**
```
Partner: "What are your plans today?"
Lin Yue: "Morning gardening, afternoon research, evening music. You?"
Partner: "I'm teaching kids programming at community school, afternoon hiking with friends."
    ↓
No concept of "going to work" or "getting off work"
    ↓
Only "What meaningful things do I want to do today"
```

**Child wakes:**
```
8-year-old Xiao Xing:
"Mom, can I visit the robot factory today?"
    ↓
Lin Yue:
"Of course, I'll arrange it. Shall we go together this afternoon?"
    ↓
Education:
- Not sitting in classroom
- But exploring interests
- Field experiences
- Personalized learning (Chapter 15)
```

---

**8:30 - Check Contribution Value and "Daily Inspiration"**
```
Lin Yue opens holographic interface:
    ↓
Contribution value: 12,450
- Increased by 230 last week (research paper published)
- Can exchange for: More life choices
    ↓
But basic living:
- Housing, food, healthcare, education
- Completely free (no contribution value needed)
    ↓
Contribution value used for:
- Travel (vacation to Europe)
- Advanced art courses
- Special experiences
```

**"Daily Inspiration" (AI recommendations):**
```
Hui:
"Based on your recent interests, recommending:
- A new paper on consciousness uploading (your research area)
- An ecological ethics discussion meeting (day after tomorrow)
- A piece of new Indian classical music (style you might like)"
    ↓
Not algorithm manipulation
    ↓
But:
- Helps discover
- Humans decide
- Completely transparent (why recommended)
```

---

**9:00 - Leave for Community Gardening**
```
5-minute walk to community center

"Wow! When did they play?"
    ↓
Lin Yue:
"Very little. Many people were tired, anxious."
    ↓
Xiao Xing:
"Why?"

    ↓
Partner:
"I said marriage is a choice, not marrying is also a choice. We love each other, that's enough."

```

---

## How Future People View Us (2025)

### In History Class (2225)

**Teacher:**
> "Today we study early 21st century, the 2020s.
> It was a pivotal era."

**Student:**
> "Teacher, did they really work 40 hours per week?"

> "Yes. And many people hated their work but had to do it, because they feared unemployment and poverty."

**Student:**
> "That's terrible. Why didn't they change?"

**Teacher:**
> "They were changing. In the 2020s, someone proposed Contribution-First theory. At first only few believed, but gradually, more and more people awakened.
> 
> They spent 50 years experimenting, 50 years in political struggle, 50 years building institutions, 50 years transforming culture.
> 
> Our life today is their gift."

> They faced:
> - Fierce opposition from vested interests
> - Challenges of immature technology
> - Risk of failure
> - Frustration of not seeing results long-term

## Problems Still Existing

### Not Perfect Utopia

**2225 still has challenges:**

**1. Meaning crisis**
```
When survival not an issue:
- What is life's meaning?
- Some people feel emptiness
- Need philosophical, spiritual support
```

**2. Relationship complexity**
```
Human nature still complex:
- Love, friendship can still hurt
- Family conflicts still exist
- Need continuous effort to maintain relationships
```

**3. Innovation bottleneck**
```
Technology highly developed:
- New breakthroughs harder
- Requires more effort
```

**4. Generational differences**
```
Five generations coexist (extended lifespan):
- Value conflicts
- Resource allocation (many elderly)
- Social vitality (how to maintain)
```

**5. Global coordination**
```
Earth unified but diverse:
- Cultural conflicts still present
- Need continuous dialogue and compromise
```

**6. AI ethics**
```
AI increasingly intelligent:
- Rights questions
- Control questions
- Human role questions
```

**7. Space exploration**
```
Humans begin colonizing Mars, Moon:
- New challenges (resources, governance)
- Relationship with Earth
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Happiness Is Not Problem-Free
```
2225:
- Still has problems and challenges
    ↓
But:
- Basic suffering eliminated (poverty, oppression, despair)
- People have resources to face challenges

```

---

### 3. Freedom Is Capability to Realize, Not Unconstrained
```
Freedom in 2225:
    ↓
Not:

But:
- Have capability to do what you want (positive freedom)
- Basic guarantee + social support + education
```

---

### 4. Meaning Comes from Contribution, Not Consumption
```
Less work:

    ↓
Because:
- Meaning not in consuming more
- But in creating, connecting, growing
```

---

### 5. Community Is Key to Happiness
```
Technology advanced:

```
200 years:
- 8-10 generations
- Long, difficult
    ↓
But:
- Finally realized
- Each generation better than previous
    ↓
Our (2025) choice:
