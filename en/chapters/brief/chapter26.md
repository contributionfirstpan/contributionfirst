---

## Resonance Between Contribution-First and New Heaven and New Earth

### Resonance 1: Practice of Love

**Christianity:**
```
Core commandment:
"Love God, love neighbor"
    ↓
1 John 3:18
"Let us not love with words or speech
but with actions and in truth"
    ↓
Love must be concrete
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Contribution values (Chapter 8):
- Helping others = Contribution
- Recognized and rewarded
    ↓
Institutions encourage love:
- Not just moral teaching
- But systemic incentive
    ↓
Basic guarantee (Chapter 13):
- Care for everyone
- Especially the weak
    ↓
Similar to concrete "love your neighbor"
```

**Jesus' Parable: Good Samaritan**
```
Luke 10:
- Priest, Levite: See injured man, pass by
- Samaritan: Stops, cares, pays expenses
    ↓
Jesus asks: Who is neighbor?
Answer: The one who showed mercy
    ↓
Contribution-First:
- Institutionalized "Good Samaritan"
- Not depend on random kindness
- But systematic care
```

---

### Resonance 2: Realization of Justice

**Christianity:**
```
Prophetic tradition:
- Voice for the poor
- Oppose exploitation
- Demand justice
    ↓
Amos 5:24
"Let justice roll down like waters,
and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream"
    ↓
Isaiah 58:
- True fasting:
  "Set the oppressed free,
   break every yoke...
   share food with hungry,
   provide shelter for wandering poor"
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Distribution by contribution (Chapter 12):
- Not by capital
- Not by birth
- But by actual contribution
    ↓
Justice = Everyone gets what they deserve
    ↓
Restorative justice (Chapter 16):
- Not revenge
- But restoration and repair
    ↓
Similar to biblical "justice"
```

**Jubilee Concept:**
```
Leviticus 25:
- Every 50 years:
  - Slaves freed
  - Debts forgiven
  - Land returned to original owners
    ↓
Purpose: Prevent permanent poverty and inequality
    ↓
Contribution-First similar mechanism:
- Contribution value not inheritable (Chapter 18)
- Prevent hereditary inequality
- Periodic "reset"
```

---

### Resonance 3: Peace and Harmony

**Christianity:**
```
Shalom (Peace):
- Not just no war
- But complete harmony
    ↓
Isaiah 2:4
"They will beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks.
Nation will not take up sword against nation,
nor will they train for war anymore"
    ↓
Isaiah 11:6
"The wolf will live with the lamb,
the leopard will lie down with the goat"
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Eliminate root of conflict (Chapter 6):
- Don't compete for scarce resources
- Basic needs guaranteed
    ↓
From competition to cooperation:
- Possession competition → Contribution competition
- Zero-sum → Positive-sum
    ↓
Global cooperation (Chapter 23):
- Community of shared future for humanity
- No more war
- Face challenges together
    ↓
Similar to "beat swords into plowshares"
```

**Harmony with Nature:**
```
Ecological priority (Chapter 7):
- Don't destroy nature
- Live in harmony with nature
    ↓
Similar to restoring Garden of Eden
```

---

### Resonance 4: Wipe Away Tears, End Suffering

**Christianity:**
```
Revelation 21:4
"God will wipe away every tear;
there will be no more death,
no more mourning or crying or pain"
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Reduce sources of suffering:
- Poverty → Basic guarantee
- Disease → Free healthcare, prevention
- Loneliness → Community connection (Chapter 8)
- Anxiety → Emotional support (Chapter 14)
- Oppression → Deep democracy (Chapter 17)
- Exploitation → Cooperatives (Chapter 18)
    ↓
Dare not say "no more suffering"
    ↓
But: Significantly reduced
    ↓
Approaching "wipe away tears"
```

**Healing and Restoration:**
```
Emotional support system (Chapter 14):
- AI + community + professionals
- Psychological trauma repair
- Relationship restoration
    ↓
Similar to "leaves of tree for healing nations"
```

---

### Resonance 5: Meaningful Work

**Christianity:**
```
Genesis 1-2:
- Humans created to "have dominion" over creation
- Not idleness, but work with purpose
    ↓
Revelation 22:3
"His servants will serve him"
    ↓
New Heaven and New Earth:
- Not doing nothing
- But perfect, meaningful work
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Ten categories of contribution (Chapter 8):
- Work, learning, creation, caregiving...
- All meaningful contributions
    ↓
Work is not:
- Forced toil (Genesis 3 curse)
    ↓
But:
- Free creation
- Using gifts
- Serving others
    ↓
Similar to "service" in New Heaven and New Earth
```

**Isaiah 65:**
```
"They will not build and another inhabit;
they will not plant and another eat"
    ↓
Contribution-First:
- Worker cooperatives (Chapter 18)
- Labor fruits to laborers
- No more exploitation
    ↓
Labor restored dignity
```

---

### Resonance 6: Fellowship and Community

**Christianity:**
```
Acts 2:44-45
"All the believers were together
and had everything in common;
they sold property and possessions
to give to anyone who had need"
    ↓
Early church:
- Shared resources
- Loved one another
- No one in need
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Community connection (Chapter 8):
- Deep relationships
- Mutual support
- Belonging
    ↓
Resource sharing:
- Everyone has basic guarantee
- Contribution value allocated by need
    ↓
Similar to early church fellowship
    ↓
But:
- Not depend on individual virtue
- But institutional guarantee
```

---

### Resonance 7: Renewal of All Things

**Christianity:**
```
Revelation 21:5
"He who was seated on the throne said:
'I am making everything new!'"
    ↓
Not destruction then rebuild:
- But transformation, renewal
    ↓
Romans 8:21
"Creation itself...will be liberated
into the freedom and glory
of the children of God"
    ↓
All creation redeemed
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Civilizational transformation (Chapters 5-6):
- From capitalism → Contribution-First
- Qualitative change
- Not destruction, but transformation
    ↓
Ecological restoration:
- Reconciled with nature
- Earth becomes "Garden of Eden" again
    ↓
Similar to "renewal of all things"
```

---

## Key Differences

### Difference 1: Sacred vs. Secular

**Christianity:**
```
New Heaven and New Earth:
- God personally creates
- Miraculous transformation
- Supernatural
    ↓
Human role:
- Trust, wait, pray
- But ultimately God's work
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
New civilization:
- Humans themselves build
- Technology and institutions
- Natural process
    ↓
Human role:
- Active, creative, responsible
- Not waiting for divine intervention
```

**Dialogue:**
```
Question: Does this conflict?
    ↓
Not necessarily:
- Theologically: God works through humans (common grace)
- Contribution-First can be God's way of working
- Not miracle, but capability God gave humans
    ↓
Calvinist theology:
- Cultural Mandate
- Humans entrusted to manage world
- Work is worship
```

---

### Difference 2: Eschaton vs. History

**Christianity (especially conservative):**
```
New Heaven and New Earth:
- At end of history
- After final judgment
- Christ's return
    ↓
Time:
- Not in this life
- But in eternity
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
New civilization:
- In historical process
- 50-200 years
- Human effort
    ↓
Time:
- Right on earth
- In this life (or children's generation)
```

**Dialogue:**
```
Question: Does this conflict?
    ↓
Interpretation 1 (Conservative):
- Contribution-First is "good effort"
- But cannot fully realize
- Only Christ's return can
    ↓
Interpretation 2 (Progressive):
- Kingdom of God "already but not yet"
- Humans participate in building God's kingdom
- Contribution-First is way to participate
    ↓
Social Gospel Movement:
- 19-20th century theological movement
- Emphasize building just society on earth
- Not just waiting for heaven
```

---

### Difference 3: Redemption vs. Reform

**Christianity:**
```
Core:
- Sin and redemption
- Personal relationship with God
- Believe in Jesus → Saved
    ↓
Focus:
- Soul salvation
- Reconciled with God
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Core:
- Institutions and reform
- Social relationships
- Build new institutions → Reduce suffering
    ↓
Focus:
- This-life improvement
- Social justice
```

**Dialogue:**
```
Not either-or:
    ↓
Complete gospel:
- Personal redemption (vertical dimension)
- Social justice (horizontal dimension)
    ↓
Both important:
- Change hearts
- Change institutions
    ↓
Contribution-First:
- Focuses on institutions
- But doesn't deny importance of personal redemption
```

---

### Difference 4: Faith vs. Reason

**Christianity:**
```
Requires:
- Faith (Hebrews 11:1)
- Believe in unseen
- Trust God
```

**Contribution-First:**
```
Based on:
- Reason
- Evidence
- Logic
- No faith prerequisite
```

**Dialogue:**
```
Not conflicting:
    ↓
Christian tradition:
- Faith seeking understanding (Anselm)
- Faith and reason compatible (Aquinas)
    ↓
Contribution-First:
- Can be way to practice faith
- Believers use reason to build better world
```

---

## Theological Reflection: Kingdom of God and Contribution-First

### Kingdom of God "Already but Not Yet"

**Theological concept:**
```
Jesus proclaimed:
"The kingdom of God is near"
    ↓
Meaning:
- Already: Begun in Jesus
- Not Yet: Awaiting full realization
    ↓
Now:
- Living between "already" and "not yet"
```

**Application:**
```
Contribution-First may be:
    ↓
Expression of "Kingdom of God" in history:
- Not full realization (not yet)
- But real progress (already)
    ↓
Humans participate in building God's kingdom
    ↓
Not waiting to fall from heaven
    ↓
But striving to realize on earth
    ↓
Lord's Prayer: "Your kingdom come;
                your will be done,
                on earth as in heaven"
```

---

### Common Grace

**Theological concept (Calvin):**
```
God's grace:
    ↓
Special grace:
- Saving grace
- Only to believers
    ↓
Common grace:
- To all people (believers and non-believers)
- Rain, sunshine, wisdom, virtue, civilization
    ↓
Purpose:
- Restrain evil
- Promote human flourishing
- Manifest God's goodness
```

**Application:**
```
Contribution-First may be:
    ↓
Expression of common grace:
- God through technology, institutions
- Improves human life
- Not everyone needs to believe
- But still God's work
    ↓
Science, democracy, human rights:
- All common grace
- Contribution-First can also be
```

---

### Cultural Mandate

**Theological concept:**
```
Genesis 1:28
"Be fruitful and multiply,
fill the earth and subdue it"
    ↓
Not just "evangelism mandate"
    ↓
Also "cultural mandate":
- Build civilization
- Develop culture
- Manage creation
    ↓
Work, art, science, politics:
- All serve God
```

**Application:**
```
Contribution-First may be:
    ↓
Practice of cultural mandate:
- Build just society
- Develop technology
- Protect ecology
    ↓
Christians participate:
- Not "secularization"
- But "sanctifying world"
- Make earth more like heaven
```

---

## Meaning for Christians

### Contribution-First Doesn't Threaten Faith

**Not saying:**
- Don't need God
- Don't need Jesus
- Don't need redemption
- Humans can self-save

**But saying:**
- While waiting for Lord's return
- We can strive to improve world
- This is way to practice faith
- Love God = Love neighbor = Build just society

---

### Two Eschatologies

**Pessimistic Eschatology:**
```
World getting worse
    ↓
Cannot improve
    ↓
Christians should:
- Flee world (monasticism)
- Focus on soul salvation
- Wait for rapture
    ↓
Social reform:
- Futile
- Even "opposing God"
```

**Optimistic Eschatology:**
```
God's kingdom growing
    ↓
Humans can participate
    ↓
Christians should:
- Actively engage world
- Build just society
- "Your kingdom come"
    ↓
Social reform:
- Serving God
- Practicing gospel
```

**Contribution-First consistent with optimistic eschatology.**

---

### Continuing Prophetic Tradition

**Old Testament prophets:**
```
Not just proclaim future
    ↓
But criticize present:
- Amos: Oppose exploitation
- Isaiah: Voice for poor
- Micah: Demand justice
    ↓
They demanded:
- Change unjust institutions
- Protect the weak
- Realize God's justice
```

**Modern prophetic role:**
```
Christians participate in Contribution-First:
    ↓
Continue prophetic tradition:
- Criticize capitalism's injustice
- Promote institutional reform
- Build more just society
    ↓
Not politicizing gospel
    ↓
But gospel's political implications
```

---

### Institutionalizing the Good Samaritan

**Jesus' parable:**
```
Traveler beaten and robbed
    ↓
Priest, Levite: Ignore
    ↓
Samaritan: Cares for him
    ↓
Jesus: You go and do likewise
```

**Problem:**
```
If:
- Thousands beaten daily
- Cannot rely on chance good people
    ↓
What to do?
```

**Contribution-First answer:**
```
Build institutions:
- Guarantee everyone is cared for
- Not depend on random kindness
- But systematic support
    ↓
This is institutionalized "Good Samaritan"
    ↓
Not replacing personal charity
    ↓
But ensuring no one is left behind
```

---

### Practicing the Sermon on the Mount

**Matthew 5-7:**

**Beatitudes:**
```
"Blessed are the poor in spirit,
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"
"Blessed are those who mourn,
 for they will be comforted"
"Blessed are the meek,
 for they will inherit the earth"
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
 for they will be filled"
"Blessed are the merciful,
 for they will be shown mercy"
...
```

**How Contribution-First embodies:**
```
Poor in spirit:
- Not proud, not greedy = Desire little, be content (Chapter 10)

Those who mourn:
- Emotional support system comforts (Chapter 14)

The meek:
- Not relying on violent competition = Cooperative culture

Hunger and thirst for righteousness:
- Build just institutions (Chapters 17-19)

The merciful:
- Restorative justice (Chapter 16)
```

---

## A Thought Experiment

### If Jesus Returned Today

**Scenario:**
```
Jesus descends to earth (second coming)
    ↓
Sees two worlds:
    ↓
1. Capitalist world:
   - Churches abound (nominally Christian nations)
   - But:
     - Wealth gap
     - Poor suffering
     - Environmental destruction
     - Wars continue
    ↓
2. Contribution-First world:
   - Fewer churches (secular institutions)
   - But:
     - No poverty
     - Everyone cared for
     - Ecology protected
     - Peaceful cooperation
    ↓
How would Jesus evaluate?
```

**Possible response:**
```
Jesus might say (referencing Matthew 25):
    ↓
"I was hungry and you gave me food
(Contribution-First: Basic guarantee)
    ↓
I was thirsty and you gave me drink
(Contribution-First: Free water)
    ↓
I was a stranger and you welcomed me
(Contribution-First: Free housing)
    ↓
I was naked and you clothed me
(Contribution-First: Basic clothing)
    ↓
I was sick and you cared for me
(Contribution-First: Free healthcare)
    ↓
I was in prison and you visited me"
(Contribution-First: Restorative justice)
    ↓
"Whatever you did for one of the least of these
brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me"
    ↓
Point is not:
- Confession of faith (verbal)
    ↓
But:
- Practice of love (action)
```

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Faith Can Motivate Action

**Not:**
```
Faith → Passive waiting
```

**But:**
```
Faith → Active building
    ↓
Believe:
- God wants justice
- God wants peace
- God wants love
    ↓
So:
- We strive to realize
- On earth as in heaven
```

---

### 2. Gospel Has Social Dimension

**Not only:**
```
Personal salvation (soul goes to heaven)
```

**But also:**
```
Social transformation (earth becomes good)
    ↓
Jesus' gospel:
- Good news to the poor
- Proclaim freedom for prisoners
- Recovery of sight for blind
- Set oppressed free
(Luke 4:18)
    ↓
Not only spiritual, but also social
```

---

### 3. Institutions Are Also Worship

**Work is worship:**
```
Not only:
- Singing, praying, Bible reading
    ↓
But also:
- Building just institutions
- Serving society
- Creating goodness
    ↓
Colossians 3:23
"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart,
as working for the Lord"
```

---

### 4. Love Requires Wisdom and Institutions

**Love not just emotion:**
```
Not enough:
- I have love (personal virtue)
    ↓
Also need:
- Wise action
- Effective institutions
    ↓
James 2:15-16
"Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes
and daily food. If one of you says to them,
'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,'
but does nothing about their physical needs,
what good is it?"
    ↓
Love must have action
Action needs institutions
```

---

### 5. New Heaven and New Earth Not Only Future

**Not:**
```
Now: Suffering
Future: New Heaven and New Earth
    ↓
So: Wait patiently
```

**But:**
```
Now: Already begun
Future: Full realization
    ↓
So: Actively participate
    ↓
"The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21)
```

---

## To Christians

**If you are Christian:**
```
You may worry:
- Contribution-First too "worldly"
- Doesn't speak of salvation
- Doesn't speak of Christ
- Doesn't speak of eternal life
    ↓
I understand
```

**But please consider:**
```
1. Jesus cared about this life and world
   - Healed sick
   - Fed hungry
   - Voiced for poor
   → Not just spoke of afterlife

2. God wants "Your will be done on earth"
   - Not just in heaven
   → Earth also matters

3. Love commandment has social implications
   - Love neighbor
   - Build just society
   → Not just personal relationships

4. Your faith can motivate participation
   - Not threatening faith
   - But practicing faith

5. Contribution-First may be God's work
   - Through human wisdom and effort
   - Realize His heart of justice and peace
```

**Invitation:**

> See Contribution-First as:
> - Practicing Great Commission and Cultural Mandate
> - Making "God's kingdom come on earth"
> - Using reason and technology to realize love commandment
> 
> Together build a world more like New Heaven and New Earth.
