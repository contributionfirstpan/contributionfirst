# Chapter 3: Moral Civilization
## The Civilizational Experiment of Moral Codes

---

## Core Question

After theocratic civilization failed, humanity tried a new approach:

**If external authority (God) is unreliable, can internal cultivation (virtue) establish order?**

---

## Core Logic: Self-Discipline Superior to External Control

### The Basic Assumption
```
Humans can achieve self-discipline through cultivation
    ↓
Self-disciplined people don't need external supervision
    ↓
Society of self-disciplined people = Ideal order
    ↓
Low cost, low constraints, high freedom
```

### Why This Seems Reasonable

**Compared to Theocracy:**
- No need to believe in unprovable God
- No need for priests as intermediaries
- Humans themselves are moral subjects

**Compared to Pure Law:**
- No need for massive surveillance systems
- No need for harsh penalties
- Internalized norms more effective than external coercion

---

## Three Major Traditions

### 1. Confucianism (China, 2500+ Years)

#### Core Concepts

**Ren (仁, Benevolence):**
- Care for others
- Empathy ("Do not do to others what you don't want done to you")
- Love starts from family, extends to all

**Yi (义, Righteousness):**
- What ought to be done
- Not profit-driven, but morally right
- "A gentleman understands righteousness; a small person understands profit"

**Li (礼, Propriety):**
- Social norms and etiquette
- Maintains order
- "Without propriety, do not look, listen, speak, or act"

**Zhi (智, Wisdom):**
- Knowing right from wrong
- Moral judgment
- "Knowing what is right but not doing it is lack of courage"

**Xin (信, Trustworthiness):**
- Keeping one's word
- Foundation of social trust
- "Without trust, one cannot stand"

#### The Ideal of the Gentleman (Junzi)

**Not born, but cultivated:**
- Study classics (The Analects, Mencius, etc.)
- Practice rituals
- Self-cultivation ("Examine yourself thrice daily")
- Ultimately become a sage (圣人)

**Social Impact:**
- Gentlemen lead by example
- Common people observe and follow
- Society naturally harmonizes

---

### 2. Stoicism (Ancient Greece-Rome, 2300+ Years)

#### Core Concepts

**Dichotomy of Control:**
```
Things within your control:
- Your thoughts
- Your judgments
- Your choices
    → Focus all energy here

Things beyond your control:
- Others' opinions
- Natural disasters
- Death
    → Accept with tranquility
```

**Living According to Nature:**
- Humans are rational beings
- Using reason to control emotions
- "It's not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things"

**Four Cardinal Virtues:**
1. **Wisdom**: Knowing what is truly good
2. **Courage**: Facing difficulties without fear
3. **Justice**: Treating others fairly
4. **Temperance**: Controlling desires

#### Famous Practitioners

**Epictetus:**
- Born a slave, became great philosopher
- "We cannot choose our circumstances, but we can choose our attitude"

**Marcus Aurelius:**
- Roman Emperor, wrote "Meditations"
- While ruling the empire, maintained Stoic self-discipline
- "The universe is change; life is opinion"

---

### 3. Kant's Moral Philosophy (18th Century Enlightenment)

#### Core Concepts

**Categorical Imperative:**
> "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."

**What does this mean?**
- Before acting, ask: "If everyone did this, would it be acceptable?"
- If not, then you shouldn't do it either

**Example:**
- Can I lie? If everyone lied, no one would believe anyone → Society collapses
- Therefore, lying is wrong

**Autonomy is the Highest Freedom:**
- Not being controlled by desires (that's slavery to emotions)
- Not being controlled by authority (that's surrender of will)
- But giving oneself moral laws (that's true freedom)

**"Humans are ends, not means":**
- Cannot use others as tools
- Every person has inherent dignity
- This is the foundation of human rights

---

## Real Historical Implementation

### Confucian Society (China, 2000+ Years)

**How It Worked:**

**Imperial Examination System:**
- Everyone could take the exam (theoretically)
- Content: Confucian classics
- Success = become an official
- Embodied: "Learning brings you to officialdom"

**Result:**
- Literati class ruled for 2000 years
- Government composed of "morally cultivated people"
- No hereditary aristocracy (like European nobility)

**Social Norms:**
- Filial piety supreme
- Loyalty to the emperor
- Three Cardinal Guides (ruler-minister, father-son, husband-wife)
- Five Constant Virtues (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trust)

**Strengths:**
- Stable governance (many dynasties lasted hundreds of years)
- Cultural continuity (unlike frequent European changes)
- Relatively low violence (compared to European religious wars)

**Problems:**
- Ossification of thought (examination system → rote memorization)
- Oppression of individuality (collectivism over individualism)
- Women's unfreedom (Three Obediences and Four Virtues)
- Hypocrisy of literati class (professing morality, acting selfishly)

---

### Stoic Philosophy (Ancient Greece-Rome)

**How It Worked:**

**From Slaves to Emperors:**
- Epictetus: Born a slave, became philosopher through self-discipline
- Marcus Aurelius: Emperor, maintained Stoic philosophy
- Showed: Anyone can practice Stoicism

**Influence on Roman Law:**
- Natural law concept
- All humans have reason
- Foundation of human rights

**Problems:**
- Elite philosophy (required education and leisure)
- Difficulty spreading to common people
- Couldn't solve material poverty issues

---

### Kantian Ethics (Modern Era)

**How It Worked:**

**Foundation of Human Rights Theory:**
- UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Based on Kant's "human dignity"
- "All people are born free and equal"

**Influence on Modern Law:**
- Cannot discriminate based on race, gender, religion
- Cannot use humans as experimental subjects
- Cannot torture

**Problems:**
- Too abstract (ordinary people struggle to understand categorical imperative)
- Multiple interpretations (what is "universal law"?)
- Cannot solve complex real-world dilemmas

---

## Why Moral Civilization Failed

### 1. Disconnect Between Moral Ideals and Human Reality

**The Problem:**

Moral civilization demands:
- Complete selflessness (Confucian benevolence, Stoic virtue)
- Perfect rationality (Kant's categorical imperative)
- Constant self-discipline (examining yourself thrice daily)

But humans are:
- Sometimes selfish (instinctive)
- Sometimes emotional (anger, fear, desire)
- Sometimes lazy (self-discipline is exhausting)

**Result:**
```
Setting saint standards
    ↓
99% of people cannot achieve
    ↓
Hypocrisy becomes norm
    ↓
"Professing morality while acting selfishly"
```

---

### 2. Hypocrisy and Corruption of Moral Elites

**Historical Evidence:**

**Confucian Scholar-Officials:**
- Publicly: Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, trust
- Privately: Corrupt, power-abusing
- Example: Ming Dynasty eunuchs, Qing Dynasty Eight-Legged Essay corruption

**Stoic Philosophers:**
- Publicly: Advocate simplicity
- Privately: Wealthy lifestyle
- Hypocrisy: Preaching morality while living luxuriously

**Church Clergy (Moral Preachers):**
- Publicly: Chastity, poverty
- Privately: Sexual misconduct, wealth accumulation
- Example: Medieval church selling indulgences

**Root Cause:**
- Moral standards too high → Hard to follow
- Moral elites enjoy privileges → Temptation to corruption
- Lack of external supervision → Unrestrained power

---

### 3. Enormous Cost of Shame Culture

**What is Shame Culture?**

**Guilt Culture (West):**
- Internal: "I feel guilty"
- Between self and God/conscience
- Even if no one knows, still feels guilty

**Shame Culture (East Asia):**
- External: "Others know, I feel ashamed"
- Between self and society
- If no one knows = no shame

**Problems with Shame Culture:**

**1. Face More Important Than Truth**
```
Making mistake
    ↓
Admitting it loses face
    ↓
Cover up, lie
    ↓
Bigger mistake
    ↓
Vicious cycle
```

**2. Enormous Psychological Pressure**
- Always concerned about others' opinions
- Cannot tolerate failure
- "Losing face worse than death"

**3. High Suicide Rates**
- Japan: Among highest in developed countries (15.3 per 100,000)
- South Korea: 24.1 per 100,000 (OECD highest)
- Taiwan, Hong Kong: Also high

**Reason:**
- Shame culture → Cannot bear shame of failure
- Failure = social death
- Physical death easier than social death

**Real Case: Japanese Seppuku (切腹)**
- Samurai commit suicide to preserve honor
- Failure, losing war, disobeying lord → Seppuku
- Extreme manifestation of shame culture

---

### 4. Cannot Solve Material Problems

**Fundamental Limitation:**

Moral civilization says:
- "A gentleman doesn't worry about poverty, worries about inequality"
- "Those who know are not as good as those who love it"
- "Cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state, bring peace to the world"

But reality is:
- People need to eat
- Need shelter
- Need to survive

**"Full food and warm clothing" is prerequisite for morality:**
- Mencius: "Only with constant livelihood can one have constant virtue"
- Hungry = No energy to cultivate virtue
- Survival crisis = Ethics collapse

**Historical Evidence:**

**Mass Starvation:**
- People eat each other (cannibalism)
- Children sold
- Where's morality?

**Conclusion:**
- Morality is spiritual food, not physical food
- Material base determines superstructure
- Pure moral preaching cannot solve material scarcity

---

### 5. Industrial Revolution's Impact

**1750-1850: Everything Changed**

**Traditional Moral Civilization:**
- Agricultural society
- Stable, slow-changing
- Moral norms slowly formed, deeply rooted

**Industrial Revolution Brought:**
- Rapid urbanization (rural → cities)
- New professions (factory workers, engineers)
- New social relations (not blood relations, but employment)
- New values (efficiency, innovation, competition)

**Conflict:**

**Traditional Morality Emphasized:**
- Stability ("Stay in your station")
- Conformity ("Don't stand out")
- Authority ("Respect elders")

**Industrial Civilization Required:**
- Mobility (job changes)
- Innovation (creative destruction)
- Equality (meritocracy)

**Result:**
- Traditional moral norms couldn't adapt
- Confucianism declined in China
- Stoicism became niche philosophy
- Kant's ethics: Respected but impractical

---

## Legacy of Moral Civilization

### ✅ Positive Legacy

#### 1. Mechanism of Internalized Norms

**Discovery:**
- External supervision has limits
- Internalized norms more effective
- "Conscience" more powerful than law

**Modern Applications:**
- Corporate culture (not just regulations)
- Professional ethics (doctors, lawyers)
- Social trust (contracts rely on good faith)

---

#### 2. Dignity of Reason (Kant)

**Core Insight:**
- Humans have reason
- Reason gives humans dignity
- This dignity cannot be violated

**Modern Impact:**
- Foundation of human rights
- Anti-slavery, anti-discrimination
- "Human dignity is inviolable" (German Constitution Article 1)

---

#### 3. Revival of Virtue Ethics

**Contemporary Philosophy:**
- Not just "what rules to follow" (rule ethics)
- But "what kind of person to be" (virtue ethics)
- Focus: Character, not just actions

**Representatives:**
- Alasdair MacIntyre: "After Virtue"
- Martha Nussbaum: Capabilities approach
- Positive psychology: Strength of character

---

### ❌ Negative Legacy

#### 1. Moral Superiority Complex

**Problem:**
- "I'm more moral than you"
- "My culture is more civilized"
- "You barbarians don't understand morality"

**Result:**
- Arrogance
- Cultural imperialism
- Inability to learn from others

**Example:**
- Late Qing: "Celestial Empire, superior culture"
- Result: Beaten, still didn't reflect
- Western powers also had this problem (White Man's Burden)

---

#### 2. Pain of Shame Culture

**East Asia's Ongoing Problem:**
- High suicide rates
- Extreme study/work pressure
- Difficulty accepting failure
- Collective bullying (ijime in Japan)

**Need to Transform:**
- From shame culture → healthy accountability culture
- Mistakes are learning opportunities, not shameful matters

---

#### 3. Anti-Innovation Tradition

**Traditional Morality:**
- Emphasizes following precedent
- "Ancestors' rules cannot be changed"
- Innovation = defying tradition = immoral

**Result:**
- Technological stagnation (China's late Qing)
- Social ossification
- Unable to adapt to change

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Morality Needs Material Foundation

**Idealistic Assumption:**
- Morality can transcend material conditions
- "Poor but virtuous"

**Realistic Truth:**
- Material scarcity → Moral collapse
- "Full food and warm clothing breeds morality"
- Economic foundation determines moral superstructure

**Lesson:**
- Contribution-First must first solve material problems
- Then discuss morality

---

### 2. Spiritual Freedom ≠ Real Freedom

**Stoic Paradox:**
- "You can't control external things, but you can control your attitude"
- "A slave can be freer than an emperor (spiritually)"

**But:**
- Spiritual freedom cannot replace physical freedom
- Even if "accepting slavery," still a slave
- True freedom must include material conditions

**Lesson:**
- Contribution-First provides both:
  - Material guarantee (basic security)
  - Spiritual freedom (voluntary contribution)

---

### 3. Saint Standards Are Unrealistic

**Moral Civilization's Mistake:**
- Demanding everyone be saints
- Setting standards too high
- Result: Hypocrisy becomes norm

**Contribution-First Approach:**
- Acknowledge humans are imperfect
- Establish realistic standards
- Encourage continuous improvement, not perfection

---

### 4. Internalized Norms Are Double-Edged

**Advantages:**
- No external supervision needed
- Low cost
- Highly effective

**Dangers:**
- Can become thought control
- Extremely difficult to change once internalized
- May suppress individuality

**Contribution-First Balance:**
- Encourage voluntary contribution (internalization)
- But allow diverse values (no single standard)
- Freedom of choice (freedom to not contribute, but only basic guarantee)

---

## Leading to the Next Chapter

**Both theocracy and morality failed. Where did humanity turn?**

**Answer: Material.**

If God is unreliable and virtue insufficient, can material wealth and technological progress solve all problems?

The Industrial Revolution began, and humanity entered a new era: Material Civilization.

Two paths emerged:
- **Capitalism**: Private ownership, market competition
- **Socialism**: Public ownership, planned economy

In the next chapter, we will see the brilliance and crisis of material civilization.
